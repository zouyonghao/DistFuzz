License generator for `licensecc` allows to create new projects (and their public and private keys) and issue licenses. 
It is a standalone project, but the code in here can be used as a (git) submodule of `licensecc` project,
so unless you don't have specific issues you should compile it from there. 

All the documentation is in the main project.
