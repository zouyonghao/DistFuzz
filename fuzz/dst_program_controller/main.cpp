/**
 * TODO
 * A general purpose distributed system controll program for fuzzing.
 *
 * Design:
 *      1. The target system should provide a script to start all programs
 *      2. These programs can get random number from specified files
 *      3. The system could provide its own operators
 *      4. It uses proxy
 *      5. A stop script
 * @note Currently for braft, I implement these logics in braft_test_main.cpp
